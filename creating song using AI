I use the creativity of an LLM to write the lyrics to our new anthem using Gemini then lyrics to music using Udio.

Verse 1

Yo, mic check, one two, can the future hear me?
Born on the Nile, where the pharaohs built their legacy
But the Nile ain't the only river, innovation's in our blood
From the pyramids that touched the sky, we aimin' for the good

They say the future's digital, a world of screens and code
But Egypt's youth got the vision, a story yet untold
We ain't afraid of algorithms, the language of the times
We'll rewrite the binary code, with verses and with rhymes
